In data science, visualization is a key component that allows you to get your ideas across. 

For this project, I use D3 (Data-Driven Documents) to generate an interactive visualization of Earthquake Frequency per State in the United States. The data is loaded from a csv and the map is created using TopoJSON topology. 

<a href='https://d3js.org/'>D3.js</a> is a JavaScript framework that allows for seamless visualization creation using HTML, CSS, and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).
